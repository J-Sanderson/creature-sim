    <p>
      This is a simple creature simulator that is based upon an understanding of
      the AI in the P.F. Magic Petz games (1995-2002). The simulator consists of
      a World object containing various Entity objects. Entities are divided
      into Item (subdivided into different item types) and Creature objects that
      inherit from the base Entity object.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Creature object has different motives that can be satisfied by moving
      toward items that emit the correct adjective - e.g. if hungry it will seek
      out items marked as 'tasty' - and run the relevant plan and state
      functions to fulfil its current goal. This mimics the adjective-based
      system implemented in the Petz games, albeit greatly simplified. Factors
      such as motives, personality values, and favourite foods and colours
      influence the creature's choice.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that due to the use of emojis for graphics, the creature's preferred
      colour may or may not actually match up to the colour of the item that you
      see, depending on your system.
